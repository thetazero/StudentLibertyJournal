        <h1>Paly welcome, A resounding success</h1>
<p><img src="/assets/brad.png" alt="Brad Klein"></p>
<p>On the morning of August the Seventeenth, the Administrators of Palo Alto High School led by the new principal, the Honorable Gentleman Brent Klein, unveiled exciting radical new plans to conduct state-of-the-art online learning. The schedule for the first week of school was designed with student integration in mind, with thirty minutes daily, designated as “Paly Welcome,” being solely dedicated to easing the difficult transition students face. Needless to say, the Administration’s proceedings were enormously successful.</p>
<p>The majority of content presented in Paly Welcome consisted of one-on-one interviews with some of the finest Honorable Ladies and Gentlemen of the Palo Alto High School Administration. The highlights of Paly Welcome include the many walk-and-talk style interviews with valued Administrators such as Margaret Reynolds, Michelle Steingart, Right Hand Man Jerry Berkson and our Leader Himself, Brad Kline. Shorter segments were dedicated to the personal introductions of some of Palo Alto High School’s beloved teachers, coaches, and counselors. Each interviewee noted their positive and supporting opinions of the Palo Alto High School community, emphasizing the importance of student outreach and involvement.</p>
<p>Student Liberty Journal reporters were able to virtually connect with a Palo Alto High School student to discuss their reaction to the Paly Welcome initiative.</p>
<p>SLJ Interviewer: “What are your first impressions of the content shown in Paly Welcome.”</p>
<p>David Wingard Jr.: “I was extremely grateful to be able to watch one-on-one interviews with some of our most esteemed Administrators. I really enjoyed the shaky cam footage of the walk-and-talks, as they helped me immerse myself in the interview and its contents.”</p>
<p>Much of the available time in the Paly Welcome was rightfully allocated to treating the Paly student body to many exclusive interviews with Brent Klein. Through InFocus, the student body was given insight on important matters such as Mr. Kline’s long running habit of digging holes, buoyantly quoted as “I’m going to dig some dirt!” When asked about his future plans, Mr. Klein enlightened the audience by explaining, “it’s gonna be soon pumpkin season.” We can only look forward to what's in store for students of this great School (You can look forward to a complete piece dedicated to Brent Klein in a future SLJ edition).</p>
<p>Student Liberty Journal approached Katherine Huang to understand the student body's reaction to Brent Kline.</p>
<p>SLJ Interviewer: “After watching Brent Klein’s interview what do you think about him?”</p>
<p>Katherine Huang: “I think I speak for most Paly students when I say he strikes me as a truly inspirational leader!”</p>
<p>Administrators/Infocus role in this (streaming it to students etc etc)/community response
Katherine Huang must be right, as the first video registered 3000 likes and only 12 dislikes: a true testament to student-Administrator collaboration. Through innovative use of technology the video was streamed directly to students’ homes, a remarkable accomplishment.</p>
<p>Special attention must be directed to praising the laborious efforts made by Administrators and InFocus journalists for making the Paly Welcome initiative, and the upcoming school year, possible. Thanks to their breakthrough use of modern technology, Administrators used InFocus to stream synced video and audio directly into the homes of Palo Alto High School students. Without them, the vastly successful Paly Welcome initiative could not have succeeded.</p>
<p>In summary, the Paly Welcome initiative has been hugely successful in integrating students into the school year, making them feel at home within the Palo Alto community.</p>
<br/>
<p>Believe in freedom.</p>
<p>Obey the law.</p>
<p>Fight for justice.</p>
